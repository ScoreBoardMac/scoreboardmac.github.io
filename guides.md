   - Open the app and configure your teams/players names, and other initial settings.  

2. **Update Scores in Real-Time**  
   - Adjust team scores using the app's user-friendly controls.

3. **Integrate with OBS Studio**  
   - In OBS, create a new *Text (FreeType 2)* source or drag and drop the desired text file into OBS.  
   - Enable the "Read from File" option and select the `.txt` file generated by the app.

4. **Stream or Record**  
   - As you update scores in the Scoreboard app, the changes are reflected in OBS in real-time. OBS will automatically read the files from the disk (approximately once per second) and display the result.
